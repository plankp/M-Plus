# Description:
#   Just a typical hello, world program. (Multiple versions)
#

# Most simple one, since MPlus prints out the result of the last
# expression
@"Hello, world"

# You could write print(@"Hello, world") which does the same
# thing, but print is more like a debug command, and as a
# result, it would actually be printed out twice (since print
# returns the printed value)
