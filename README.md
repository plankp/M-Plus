# M+

A programming language that took a lot from [NtShell](https://github.com/plankp/NtShell)

(and no, just in case you are wondering, the syntax is not 100% compatible so most code will need to be rewritten)

## To build M+

You need:
*  CMake >= 2.8.12
*  C++11 supporting compiler

```
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
```

## To run M+ interpreter

`mplus [MPlus script]`
