# M+

A programming language that took a lot from [NtShell](https://github.com/plankp/NtShell)

(and no, just in case you are wondering, the syntax is not 100% compatible so most code will need to be rewritten)

## To build M+

(Tested on Msys2 and should work on linux)

You need:
*  GNU Make
*  GNU G++ (C++11 supporting)

run `make` and you get `mplus`

## To run M+ interpreter

`mplus [MPlus script]`
