# MPlus [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/825xhlrdh0eahyrf/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/plankp/m-plus/branch/master)

A programming language that took a lot from [NtShell](https://github.com/plankp/NtShell)

(and no, just in case you are wondering, the syntax is not 100% compatible so most code will need to be rewritten)

## To build M+

You need:
*  CMake >= 3.0.0
*  C99 supporting compiler
*  C++11 supporting compiler

```
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
```

## To run M+ interpreter

`mplus [MPlus script]`

## To code in M+

See the *__sample__* code in the `sample` folder. That hopefully helps!
